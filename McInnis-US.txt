As a user, I want to view flights departing from multiple nearby airports, so I can select the most economical flight closest to me.
As a user who dislikes flying, I want to find flights with the least amount of layovers so I can minimize my travel time.
As a premium user, I want to only view flights with first-class tickets available so I can have access to first class lounges in airports.
